# FrontEndTravelBlog.FullStack
Front End Tech Training - HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP

This is a beginner project utilising front end technology. The concept is to document the holidays I've been on with my partner.
As the website evolves, I will add pages and link them with menus etc. Once that is done, a login system may be implemented.

Thus far the project is to document my beginnings in development and keep track for future reference.
