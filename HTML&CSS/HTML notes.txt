Notes on HTML

Hyper Text Markup Language
Structure behind every web page
Responsible for Paragraphs, Videos, Images, Fonts, Bold, Italics, underlines etc etc
Responsible for every part you see on a page but doesn't include stylings (animations, colours etc)
It's a template structure/Skeleton
---
Can be written in basic text editors
---
Hundreds of browsers but when doing this...
Six primary browsers: IE, Edge, FireFox, Chrome, Safari and Opera

Each browser manages HTML a little bit differently
i.e using bold in all browsers works the same because it's an old standard but canvas may not be supported by older browser versions
i.e keep them up to date.
Check latest versions because difference between chrome 1 and chrome 42 is massive
Browsers evolve and more elements become standardised

When building a website, test pages on as many different browsers as possible. 6 mentioned above.
----

format

<htmltag> content between the tags </htmltag>
<p>, <b>, <i>
<i>italics</i>
<b>bold</i>

Self closing elements
Some elements don't have content in between them because they use 'attributes'
e.g imgage tag <img src="website.com/image.jpg" />  this closes itself because no content goes inside an image except itself

Can then use nesting, can create a hierarchy and maintain through indenting. Example below.
lowercase html tags are pretty much standard

<p>
	Hey, I'm a paragrah. <b>I am bold</b>
</p>	
--

Doctype basically lets the browser know it's a html page<!DOCTYPE html>

----

Attributes modify elements and add additional information to an elements

Many elements have certain attributes they can access.

Will always be specified in the opening tag.

I.e language attribute in the <html> tag which is <html lang="en-US">

There are global attributes which can be used on almost any tag such as title

I.e <p> but add a title so when you hover over the title it appears above the text so:

<p title="New York Experience">
	<b>New York</b> Was the first place on our list.
</p>

Images have a few such as width, height, title (as above),  alt (which shows text if the image isn't available), src (which is the source)
so code will be:
<img width="250" height="250" title="Picture from New York" alt="Damn, where has the picture gone?" src="https://i.imgur.com/eGHRwF1.jpg" /> 
all attributes and elements should be lowercase

double or sigle quotes work  "" or '' but not just width=250

spaces seperate attributes ie <span title=This is a simple title>Test Span</span> wont work because editor is 
treating each word as a seperate attribute. So quotation marks sort this out:

<span title="This is a simple title">Test Span</span> works now. quotation marks are like a wrapper and double quotes
seem to be the standard for HTML

there are other attributes which can add stuff like css such as class="" id="" and style=""

----

Headers

Can use h1 - h6 header tags.

h1 is largest header available and goes down till h6. <h1></h1>
h1 is probably the most important to web searches as search engines look for it. This goes into SEO. 
Don't really use more than one h1 tag in a page to help with SEO

---

HTML is not space sensitive. Need to manually break lines <br>

To add more than one space is to &nbsp;

----

Bold is adding <b></b> with text between them
Italics is <i></i> with text between them
Underline is different now in html5 but <u></u> has been deprecated and is meant to show words different from normal text
ie misspelled characters or foreign stuff.
Not meant to be used really in standards. Proper way is to show something that doesn't fit in.
If you really wanna underline stuff just for the sake of it, CSS might be better.
----

Comments on code in html <!-- all this is a comment, close it  -->

-- 
links found everywhere. Hyperlinks connect all sorts. Example will go to google. <a> element</a> but need an attribute which is
href
There is another attribute called target which starts with _. the values available are:
_blank - opens in new window
_parent - opens links in the document frame if there is one
_self - default and opens in current window. If you don't specify target, it will do this
_top - will open document in full body of the window

Only define one of these^^ 
so <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">Google this</a>

----

Internal links link within the same page
<a href"#link1">this link</a> the #identifies a number. So you can now get there by using the <a name="link1"></a>


-----

Images are identified shorthand as img and is a self closing tage so it's <img src="https://imgur.com/gallery/bRpxA" />
So can be .gif .jpg .jpeg .png .svg

Once you have the image can assign other attributes such as border so <img src="https://i.imgur.com/O7QbvcW.jpg" border="1"/>

Or alt text in case it can't find or display the image 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/O7QbvcW.jpg" border="1" alt="Oh dear, it's gone"/>

Can also define the width and height <img src="https://i.imgur.com/O7QbvcW.jpg" border="1" alt="Oh dear, it's gone" width="250" height="250"/>

Or we can give it a title <img src="https://i.imgur.com/O7QbvcW.jpg" border="1" alt="Oh dear, it's gone" width="250" height="250" title="New York at night"/>

You can turn it into a link as well by encapsulating it with  <a href="https://google.com/"></a>

----

Div 
Assigned by <div></div> 
Has no special use, it's a dummy element. No special purpose or use. It's customisable through CSS.
Found pretty much everywhere on the internet. HTML 5 tries to remove the need for div because we have up to date standards
so instead of <div></div> we have specifics such as:
<header></header> instead of <div id="header"></div>
<footer></footer>
<nav></nav>
It's an empty container
Atm we just create blocks that go from left to right on page. as I become more skilled I'll start adding loads of em

---

Blocks v inline

Every element in HTML can be classed as either block or inline elements

block is element such as div, paragraph headings etc. Takes up the entire width from left to right or area it's contained in.

i.e <div style="border:1px solid red;">
	This is a block element</div>

Inline element only takes up space it needs to. I.e span element
	<span style="border:1px solid red;">
		This is inline
	</span>

Block goes all across the screen, parent is the body
inline wraps around the span it's in

Nested div below to show what it takes up

	<div style="border:1px solid blue; padding:30px; width: 50%;">
	blue 50% border
	
	<div style="border:2px solid black;">
		100
	</div>
	
	<span style="border:1px solid red;">
		Inline
	</span>
	

	</div>
	
	<div style="border:1px solid blue; width:50%;">
		Another 50% blue
	</div>	

The above should sit side by side but because it's a block element it takes up 100% even if you say only 50% it takes 100% 
from left to right so there's empty white space that the block has reserved. This means any span elements will go below

SPAN: USE WHAT IT NEEDS AND NO MORE
BLOCK: FUCK YOU, GIMME IT ALL

block will take up as much space as it can, inline will take up bare minimum

facebook header with logo etc is block element.

You can create columns inside blocks with styling

----

Lists

2 types, unordered and ordered

Unordered uses bullet points etc to show ordered
Ordered list uses numbers or letters to show ordered
unordered is

<body>
	Unordered List
<ul>
<li>List item</li>
<li>List Item 2</li>
</ul>

</body>

If there is no closing tag it creates a new line ie with typos. Browser trying to correct what it thinks you were doing.

Ordered Lists
<ol>
	<li>List 1</li>
	<li> l2</li>
	<li>l3</li>
	
</ol>

Can nest lists and diff types within each other ie:

<ul>
	<li>One</li>
	<li>Two	
		<ol>
			<li>Ordered1</li>
			<li>ordered2</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>3rd</li>
</ul>

----

Tables are used but not as common anymore. Used by div a lot now but will need to use them.

Table elemenet is <table></table> create rows with <tr></tr> but need to add cells with <td></td> so it looks like the below.
You can also add a border to give it definition and define the width of the table i.e 100%.
Other attr are cellpadding (inside the cells) and cellspacing (between cells). bordercolor="red":

Can effect column span to address size of columns and stuff the attr is colspan="noofcolumns".

TH is for table head and makes it bold and centres it. Different from td.

Can affect column width etc as well from any single cell width="50%" etc. If they aren't specified, browsers will optimise
i.e adding more text to one cell will squish others sometimes

<table border="1" width="100% cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="red""> 
<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Head 1</th>
			<th>Head2</th>
			<th>Head3</th>
			<th>Head4</th>
		</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr> 
		<td rowspan="2">
			1-1 (Data)
		</td>
		<td>
			1-2(Data)
		</td>
		<td>
			1-3 (Data)
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr> 
		<td>
			2-1 (Data)
		</td>
		<td>
			2-2(Data)
		</td>
		<td colspan="2">
			2-3, 2-4(Data) WORKING HERE
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr> 
		<td>
			3-1 (Data)
		</td>
		<td>
			3-2(Data)
		</td>
		<td>
			3-3(Data) WORKING HERE
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
	<tfoot>
		<tr>
			<th>Foot1</th>
			<th>Foot2</th>
			<th>Foot3</th>
			<th>Foot4</th>
		</tr>
	</tfoot>





</table>

Metadata

Helps scrapers etc find out what website is about. Might not be in plain view but computers read it
Metdata is a self closing tag <metadata/> but it's the attributes that are what is important ie:
<metadata charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="keywords" content="travel,blog,travel blog, chris, rebecca, new york, san francisco, los angeles, honolulu">
<meta name="description" content="A travel blog that sums up mine and Rebecca's trip to America, as well as other places we've been">
<meta name="subject" content="Travel Blog">
<meta name="copyright" content="Northern Digital Contracting">
<meta name="language" content="EN">
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
<meta name="revised" content="Thursday, April 12th, 8:41am">
<meta name="classification" content="Business">

Entities

HTML has some reserver characters. ie if I try to write <name> it wont show up in browser but will in code
Can show special characters by startig with an ampersand i.eGHRwF1
&lt; - less than <br/>
&gt; - greater than <br/>

&lt;name&gt; shows as <name> 

entities are ways to create symbols the & to display in html is &amp;
copyright symbol is &copy;
extra space &nbsp - nonbreaking space

Just google a list of html entities

----

forms - VERY IMPORTANT

are how we submit data to a server or another server

<form> inside the body
<form>
	<input/>
	<text area> </textarea>
	<button></button>
	<select></select>
	
</form>

Form has a few attributes such as <form method="" either get or post
Get shows up on URL bar and not a good idea for secure stuff
post goes silently in the background

Have the action attribute so <form action="login.php" action is the file you want it linking to

Example for input area with text. Can also have colour, button, checkbox etc

<form>


	Enter Name:
	
	<h2>NAme</h2>
		Text<input type="text"/>
		Check<input type="checkbox"/>
		Color<input type="color"/>
		Date<input type="date"/>
		Email<input type="email" autofocus="autofocus"/>
		File<input type="file"/>
		Hidden<input type="hidden"/>
		Number<input type="number"/>
		Password<input type="password"/>
		Radio<input type="radio"/>
		URL<input type="url"/>
		
		<h2>Attributes</h2>
		autofocus="" - when refreshed goes straight to field
		disabled="" - duh
		checked="" - checked boxes
		min="" max="" - numbers
		value="prefilled text" - duh
		readonly="" - duh
		placeholder="Password Here" - greyed out
		maxlength="" - for text
		autocomplete="on" or "off" - not equal to itself like the others
		name="" - what shows up in the url query string
		
	Forms etc can all have global attributes like title, class and IDs
</form>


INPUT


<input>

USer input works as exactly that. syntax is 

<input type="text" placeholder="First Name" size="50"/> see the forms above

TEXT AREA

LArge portions of text. Goes inside the form area, is not self closing. 
<form>
<textarea>This is expandable and space sensitive.</textarea>
</form>

Can add columns to it. They are based on the character inside it. Columns are an attribute though.

so
<textarea cols="150" rows="10">
1
2
				3 tabulation
4
</textarea>

Can accept all global atributes as with above

BUTTONS
-----

Lots of uses inside forms etc. Styled in different ways. Diff types of them though.

<button type="submit">submit</button>- submits info
<button type="reset">submit</button> - resets to default vals
<button type="button">Does nothing</button>

Can have buttons that do nothing that can be used in CSS, Jvascript or jquery


DROPDOWN MENU
-----

Created useing the <select>
<form>
<select name="select">
	<option value="1">value1</option>
	<option value="2">value2</option>
	<option value="3">value3</option>
	<option value="test">Test</option

</select>
<button type="submit">submit</button>
</form>


selected="selected" makes an option selected by default
