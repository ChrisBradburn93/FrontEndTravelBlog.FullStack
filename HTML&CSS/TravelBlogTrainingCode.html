	I'm <b>Chris</b>, I'm starting this website as both a practice for my <i>HTML, CSS</i> and <i>Javascript</i> skills, 
	as well as a way to write down and record all the fantastic times I've had with my partner,
	<b>Rebecca</b>. Recently we returned from a trip to the <b>USA</b>.
	<br>
	We decided the best way to lay it all out is day by day and there's 16 of 'em!
	<br>
	The days kind of bleed into each other. Reason for this is every trip would start in one country/state and end in another. As exhausting as it was confusing.
	<br>
	Time travel is involved a lot in this. Not in a weird Dr Who way, just normal timezone shenanigans.
	What did you think I meant?
	</p>

	<p>	We'll cover all of them in their own section.

		This trip changed us and ignited a desire to <b>travel</b>. 
		This website is a log of our adventures in the above places, and we will add more entries as we go further afield.

		Now that I have your attention, let's move on to the adventure itself. We booked a holiday in September 2017 after only being together for about <i>4 months.</i>
		<br>
		<br>
		Christ, that could have backfired. Obviously it didn't. <b>phew!</b>.
		<br>
		<br>
		Anyway, we booked the holiday for a great price and it came around before we knew it. It turned into an amazing adventure that I wouldn't have wanted to spend with anyone else.

	<p>
		<h3>Day 0: Manchester and Snow</h3>
	</p>

	<p>
		The day before flying to New York was probably the best day one could have before any holiday.
	</p>

	<p>
		It was snowing so badly I couldn't get my car off the estate and had to work from home. Mother nature, you take care of me so good.
	</p>

	<p>
		Becca used this time to fight her way to the shops and get the last bits and bobs, whilst I stayed home and worked my buns off.

					It was a really <i><b>ruff</b></i> day

		</figure>
	</p>	
		
	<p>
		Before we knew it, we were packed and on the train from Durham to Manchester for a night in a hotel ready for the 9am flight. I <i>love</i> hotel showers.
		Feeling quite nervous about flying at this point but I resolve to not let my fears stop me from living how I want to.
		
		
	</p>	

	<p>
		<h3>Day 1: Flying, New Jersey and wow!</h3>
	</p>

	<p> 
		Early start. 5:30am. It's hard because we didn't even get to sleep until past 12. My grumbling doesn't last long though, we're both too excited.
	</p>

	<p>
		The good news is Becca has stopped worrying so much about <i>everything</i>. We've had such conflicting approaches to this holiday.
		I'm happy to wing it (which is basically my attitude to life as a whole), whereas she likes to have all the details worked out. This meant a lot of panic in the run up to this trip.
	</p>

	<p>
		Still, all sorted now. She can relax.
	</p>

	<p>
		A quick uber ride has us at the airport where after a fancy breakfast at Frankie and Benny's, I find out that I don't like mimosas.
		Before we know it we're strapped in on the plane and have taken off, with me visibly sweating and shaking.
