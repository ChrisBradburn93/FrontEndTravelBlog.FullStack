	<h1>USA Travels</h1>
		
<p>
	I'm <b>Chris</b>, I'm starting this website as both a practice for my <i>HTML, CSS</i> and <i>Javascript</i> skills, 
	as well as a way to write down and record all the fantastic times I've had with my partner,
	<b>Rebecca</b>. Recently we returned from a trip to the <b>USA</b>.
	<br>
	We decided the best way to lay it all out is day by day and there's 16 of 'em!
	<br>
	The days kind of bleed into each other. Reason for this is every trip would start in one country/state and end in another! Time travel is involved a lot as well.<br> Not in a weird Dr Who way, just normal timezone way.
	What did you think I meant?
	</p>
<p>
	The first place that comes to mind is the  but we'll cover all of them in each section. In total we went to four different and wonderful places:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#link1">New York</a></li>
		<li><a href="#link2">San Francisco</a></li>
		<li><a href="#link3">Honolulu</a></li>
		<li><a href="#link4">Los Angeles</a></li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	This trip changed us and ignited a desire to <b>travel</b>. 
	This website is a log of our adventures in the above places, and we will add more entries as we go further afield.
	<br>
	If you want to see where we went in more detail, you can <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/" target="_blank">have a look here</a>.
